# Lumiere (Web)
A website designed and built by Haoxuan and me as the final project for INFO 1998 (Trends in Web Development), in which we used React.js to build the website, Chakra UI for CSS styling, as well as FirebaseAuth and FirebaseFirestore as our backend for authentication and data storage. This is a website that allows the user to add movies that they've watched and give a personal rating and comment on the movie.
